    <h6>Concept</h6>
    <p>We infiltrated search results on eBay, FaceBook and more, with incongruous and bizarre results. Strapline: The start of something different. </p>
    <p>This imposter link takes you to a site where users sell off segments of their life, as in ‘I’m selling off Saturday’. </p>
    <p>Bid for this 'life pimp’ and if you win, you're off to take the person's place for that period of time.</p>
    <p>I liked the idea of auctioning off something never before sold on eBay or Amazon. Being you for a couple of hours is practically worthless to you, but a priceless adventure to someone with a different life.</P>
