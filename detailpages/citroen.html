	<h6>Concept</h6>
	<p>Imagine you could take one last drive through your city, before leaving forever. What would your route be?</p>
	<p>On your last night drive through your city, your tail lights leave a red trail. Our site compares red trails from hundreds of users, highlighting the parts of the city most memorable to locals.</P>

		<h6>Copy</h6>
		<p>You -- This is your city</P>
		<p>Drive -- What is your route</p>
		<p>DS3 -- Lights up its city</p>
		<p>The ultimate Parisian car expresses itself in light. In its triple-diamond Xenon headlights. Its 3D tail lights. In its daring LED city lights.</p>
		<p>Equipped with just a GoPro and their Citroën DS3, six Parisians take you on 'the' drive through the city of lights as they know it.</p>
