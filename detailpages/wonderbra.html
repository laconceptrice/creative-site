Engage your Full Effect by passing arms through the loops of your Full Effect bra, hooking securely at the back and lifting your assets comfortably inside the cups.</p> <p>2. Prance about a bit to test (Full Effect may otherwise not engage correctly). Shaking the shoulders while looking in the mirror works well; leaning forward slightly and giggling, also effective.</p> <p></p> <p>FULL EFFECT ACTIVATORS</p> <p>1 point</p> <p>- Any form of skipping, any location</p> <p>- Falling over, giggling, getting up, falling over</p> <p>2 points</p> <p>- Talk out loud to objects. 'What's that Mr Mirror, fabulous you say?'</p> <p>- Get creative with a biro and draw a big heart somewhere on yourself</p> <p>3 points</p> <p>- Every time you stand up, sit down again and say 'oops, forgot my fabulousness' then stand up and walk off</p> <p>- Write FULL EFFECT on a bit of paper and stick it to the mirror, then every morning put a tick beside the word</p> <p></p> <p>FULL EFFECT YOUR WORLD</p> <p>SEROTONIN</p> <p>'Serotonin makes more serotonin', is what we say. Maybe biochemists say other things, like 'I love to keep biros in my breast pocket', but what we're saying is not that, it's 'serotonin makes more serotonin'. When you start out invincible, you just draw more invincibility to you. It's not called a Wonderbra for nothing. </p> <p>STYLE 3D</p> <p>Boost babes have a way of life. We say if it's worth doing, it's worth boosting. We plump our lips, we up the calories on our mascara, we go big on sunglasses and we have been known to roll our hair or even, and here's a statement, to blow-dry it upside-down. Yeah, 80s style. Because if once is good, twice is better. </p> <p>SLIPPY</p> <p>Keep moving. When you're a boost-a-holic you're always onto your next boost. You talk to everyone, you call people you only just met (works best with gals as men can be plain annoying in this department), you're saying 'I'll walk down with you' when you don't know the person. Then you don't hang around, you slip right off. Because you're on the move, in the groove and change is the spice of your life.</p> <p>STARS</p> <p>Boost-a-holics need to know - everything. That means, who's doing what, where, when and what for. Once in there is no out, you're hooked on the soap opera of the world and that includes everyone around you, in the media, in politics. And a great way to check people out is to get up and current on their horoscope. Who'd have thought that Mr X of the House of Lords did that thing because he's a Virgo? Only you!</p> <p>SO WHAT?</p> <p>When you know you are cherries on toast, everything goes your way. You are the only person you depend on to get your BOOST ON and nothing and no-one can de-boost a boost lady. Tell yourself, write it down, wriggle your Full Effect on and think, 'So what?' That is the attitude of winners. Boost your number one (you) and the world is your best boost friend. Because if you're sure of yourself, things will go your way.</p> <p>
