	<h6>Script: The Date (Qashqai)</h6>
	<p>Evening in a city. Our hero picks up his date at the entrance of her building. </p>

	<p>They drive out of frame and the lights in the lobby of her building flicker and go out.</p>

	<p>As he turns the first corner, the lights in her whole street die out. </p>

	<p>An urban street stretches ahead. One by one the shop lights go out as the Qashqai passes, leaving darkness. </p>

	<p>The girl looks back, surprised. The driver smiles. </p>

	<p>They turn onto a main street. Street lights go out one by one, shops flicker and go out. A tiny hotdog stand stays on and the people at it look around surprised. </p>

	<p>The driver is circulating to turn out as many lights as he can.</p>

	<p>Aerial view: whole areas of the city are out.</p>

	<p>He takes a small street and the single bar in it goes black. </p>

	<p>They cross a suspension bridge. Behind, we see the city has gone dark. The bridge lights go out. </p>

	<p>Off the bridge, he turns and parks his Qashqai, at a vantage point over the dark city.</p>

	<p>VO: </p>
	<p>The best way to discover the new</p>
	<p>Is to leave everything you know behind</p>

	<p>The driver smiles at girl, stops engine. The sky is lit up with a million stars, visible over the dark city. The girl is amazed.</p>

	<p>VO:</p>
	<p>Drive into the unknown</p>

	<h6>The Game (Juke)</h6>
	<p>Friends challenge themselves to drive every street of their town without ever taking the same street more than once.</p>

	<h6>The Exit (X-Trail)</h6>
	<p>A man drives out of the city. Fog envelops the road behind him. His GPS erases roads driven as he leaves.</p>
